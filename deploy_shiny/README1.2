## 🚀 Food Vulnerability Dashboard (Decatur County, GA)
**Version:** 1.2 — July 2025  
**Live App:** https://phinnphace.github.io/MVP-Food-access-county/

**Project Overview:**  
This project builds on Version 1.0, migrating from Streamlit to PyShiny/Shinylive for improved mapping and full client-side deployment (Python in-browser via Wasm). The current phase is a methods testbed: Decatur County serves as a pilot case to prototype and surface analytic pain points in food access vulnerability modeling.

**Key Features:**
- **Custom Vulnerability Index:** Flexible, weighted/unweighted scoring options for transparency.
- **Systemic Penalties:** Built-in penalties for transit deserts, digital divides, and rural exclusion.
- **Dynamic LILA Flag:** On-the-fly calculation of USDA "Low Income Low Access" (LILA) tracts per ERS 2020 methodology.
- **Equity/Intersectionality Commitment:** All measures are contextualized for rurality and resource deserts; see `METHODS.md` for anti-flattening, anti-erasure rationale.

**Major Changes Since v1.0:**
- Migration to PyShiny (Shinylive) for in-browser mapping (GeoPandas, Folium, Altair).
- Addition of tract-level areal interpolation for SDOH features.
- Expanded variable set and refined vulnerability scoring logic.

**Limitations & Next Steps:**
- Static model tested only on Decatur County.
- Supermarket data cross-validated against OSM but not exhaustively field-verified.
- Contextual weighting remains under development; see [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for progress.

**Provenance:**  
Original README (v1.0) included in repo for documentation traceability.
